# TheAliProject

*(Work in progress)*

2D Platformer game in which you will be joining Ali in his journey to get his lover back.

- 2D Artist: Irina Arsagova.
- Game Developer: Sergio Calahorro.

# What I learned

1. Working with sprites and creating animations in 2D.
2. Game design.
3. Creating a player controller:
  - Can move, jump, throw projectiles using a weapon.
  - Has awareness of its surroundings (detects if it's on ground, if it's on a slope, if it's touching a wall).
  - Can learn more abilities as the game progresses.
4. Setting up check points that allow you to restart the game from there when you've died, saving your progress.
5. Improvements in setting the communication between scripts and developing more decoupled code.
6. Game feel aspects.
